# Simply Typed Lambda Calculus Extended
Haskell implementation of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with a variety of extensions, type checking and inference (algorithm T, as of yet).

## Instructions
The steps for setting up this project are as follows:

```cabal build```

```cabal run```

If warnings appear, fix them! In case you're required to install a missing dependency, it can be accomplished by using a command like:

```cabal install --lib <library_name>```

It's very likely to be a missing dependency - that is, the issue - so this should suffice.

**You need cabal and GHC in order to use this, as you may have already noticed.**

Once you're running the program, write ```:?``` and press enter - it should give you about half the indications you need.

As for the other half, I suggest taking a look at **Benjamin Pierce's "Types and Programming Languages" book**, most particularly its 11th chapter (which pertains to extensions).

## Syntax

I'm going to show each construct and its meaning in a very informal manner.

| Syntax                | Semantic        | Type      |
|:---------------------:|:---------------|:---------|
| true                  | **true**<br>a primitive value      | Bool |
| false                 | **false**<br>a primitive value     | Bool |
| if t1 then t2 else t3 | **if statement**<br>both possible outputs must be of the same type<br>and the condition has to be a boolean | Bool, where t1 has type Bool and T2 = T3, where type of t2 is T2 and type of t3 is T3 |
| 0                     | **0**<br>a primitive value         | Nat  |
| succ t                | **successor of a natural**<br>used on naturals<br>otherwise there will be an error | Nat<br>where t has type Nat |
| pred t                | **predecessor of a natural**<br>used on naturals<br>otherwise there will be an error<br>using it on 0 converts itself into 0 | Nat<br>where t has type Nat |
| iszero t              | **checks if t is 0**<br>if so then converts into true else false | Bool<br>where t has type Bool |
| x                     | **lambda calculus variable**<br>it can be any name ending with any number of primes (like myX')<br>this is only meant to have no abstraction in cases<br>where its type is being infered | Type variable t<br>it may have any type, depending on the abstraction |

| unit                       | **unit**<br>a primitive value | Unit |
| t1;t2                      | **sequencing**<br>where t1 has to have type Unit<br>and it will be thrown away after evaluating | T, where T is the type of t2, and t1 must have type Unit |
| t as T                     | **ascription**<br>where T is a type given by the programmer and t's type must match it | T, where T is the type of t |

## Types

There are two primitive types: Bool, Nat and Unit. Bool is for booleans, Nat is for natural numbers, starting from 0, and Unit is for unit (with not real application besides sequencing, here). Then there are type variables, which are only used for type inference; they are written as a "t" followed by some number starting from 1.

{l1:T1, ..., ln:Tn} is the product type, for records.

\<l1:T1, ..., ln:Tn\> is the sum type, for variants.

T->T' is the type arrow, for abstractions typically.

List T is the list type where the elements of a list are all of type T.
