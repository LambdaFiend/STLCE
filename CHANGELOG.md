# Revision history for STLCE

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2026-02-10

* First version. Named STLCE.
* It includes a lexer/parser and pretty printing.
* Its core being simply typed lambda calculus with extensions, typechecking, evaluation and desugaring for most constructors.

## 0.1.1.0 -- 2026-02-16

* Second version. Still named STLCE.
* It includes all previous features with the addition of a somewhat capable REPL, type inference using algorithm T and W, depending on the necessity (checking vs infering with T vs infering with W).
* Added default tests in case the user needs help understanding the capabilities of STLCE.

## 0.2.0.0 -- 2026-02-28

* Third version. Renamed to YALCI.
* It includes all previous features with the addition of System F and existential types which can be encoded using System F (despite that, it was not implemented due to it requiring the dev to work unecessaraly; not that it was that difficult, you can check its encoding in B. Pierce's book TAPL).
* Many improvements (a.k.a., generally, bug fixes) were made in general.
* Added even more tests cases, mostly from Pierce's own tests.
